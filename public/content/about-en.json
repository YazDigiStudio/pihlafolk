Finno-Ugric culture is also an essential, broader world. pihla folk's values stem from these roots, challenging our era's individualistic and fast-paced worldview.",

      "text": "pihla folk's modern approach embraces acoustic and archaic music as well as fusion. Traditions live and evolve acoustically and more subtly, while stronger genre-crossing can open up new, distinctive sounds at its best. Electronics are often a central element in fusions.\n\nStrong knowledge and understanding of traditions, a sensitive working approach, and diverse networks help to work successfully with cross-border and even controversial traditions.\n\nOther projects also find their way to the desk, but in those cases too, there is good communication with pihla folk's profile.\n\npihla folk is generally on the side of peace in the world, but due to its profile, it must be emphasized that pihla folk stands against the war in Ukraine and Putin's regime."

      "text": "I am Mari Pääkkönen, founder of pihla folk. I was born in Kuhmo, on the eastern border of Kainuu. My interest and enthusiasm for folk tradition began as a child, and as a student in my early twenties, I properly discovered the world of archaic folk music. During the spring of my first university year, it became clear to me that I wanted to work in the cultural field, and I haven't seriously questioned that since.",

      "text": "I studied speech communication (now communication) as my major, with two focus areas: management communication and interaction in work communities, and technology-mediated interaction. My minor subjects include drama education, music administration and production, the Culture Keys study module (including musicology, philosophy of art and art history), philosophy, entrepreneurial economics, and service design. I graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 2008 and Master of Philosophy in 2010. My master's thesis topic was Management Communication at a Festival - a case study of Kuhmo Chamber Music. I started as a professional in the cultural field in 2009.\n\nIn the field of folk and world music, I have extensive work history in various production roles, from artist management, international cultural projects, festival production, and arts communication with key institutions, organizations, and actors in the field, including Musiikkijuhla Sommelo, Kainuu Folk Music Association, Folk Music Institute, Kaustinen Folk Music Festival, World Music Centre / Etnosoi! festival, Etno-Espa.\n\nIn the independent field, I've always been fascinated by precisely that freedom. Exciting works and productions have included Blood, Porn and Propaganda, DAMMIT! - a feminist folk music series 2018-2020 (Amanda Kauranne), which was awarded Phenomenon of the Year at Etno-gala 2020. Singing Bird Trip - a hybrid nature trip 2021 (Jimmy Träskelin). Longer production arcs have always taken me furthest forward. This has been the case with the Sung Kalevala audiobook project ongoing since 2020.\n\nThe East drew me irresistibly to Karelian, Baltic Finnic, and even more broadly Finno-Ugric peoples and their traditions, cultures, and languages. The timing was, of course, bad. My heart broke on the morning of February 24, 2022. It broke for the Ukrainians. It broke for all those people living in Russia who have never voted for Putin and oppose the war.\n\nI believe that better times will come when we can create new, ethically sustainable ways of cross-border cooperation. Recent years have opened Estonia to me even more intensively, and I rejoice greatly in that. And during the worst Corona time, when most of the world was closed, it happened that I started strategic internationalization, and it is still one important and inspiring cornerstone of my work.\n\nAnd in the wave and waves of all these things, I decided to start a company, and pihla folk was born on August 1, 2022. Currently, I have the honor of being a board member of the foundation behind Juminkeko - the Kalevala and Karelian Culture Centre located in Kuhmo, starting from February 2025."
