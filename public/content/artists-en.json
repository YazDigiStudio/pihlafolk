      "bio": "Born from a thunderstorm, FRÄNDER emerged like lightning — a fusion of Nordic roots and modern attitude became heavy folk. From the deep forest of Sweden & Estonia, with energy and a warm presence they deliver heavy grooves and seductive harmonies that weave a mesmerizing soundscape.\n\nFollowing their acclaimed debut and global touring, the band's groundbreaking second album FRÄNDER II pushes the limits of what folk can be – with subtle echoes of Led Zeppelin and Jethro Tull meeting the pulse of Nordic tradition they blend folk music with the raw power and weight of hard rock in an incomparable way, they craft a sound that's both ancient and modern, acoustic yet heavy, mystical yet fiercely alive – they make the folk music tradition their own. Expect a live show where folk music becomes a living, breathing force! FRÄNDER is one of Sweden's biggest folk music exports.\n",

      "bio": "Ensemble Gamut! is a fresh, experimental collective of early music and folk music specialists, who are constantly searching for new ways to perform early music. Led by Aino Peltomaa, they have created their unique sound by combining and daringly rearranging elements from medieval music and Finnish folk songs with improvisation and electronic soundscapes.\n\nThe name of the ensemble is derived from medieval music theory (Guido of Arezzo), but also means a colour reproduction, a subset of colours. Kamut means \"friends\" in Finnish, and the word Kamu is also short for \"kansanmusiikki\", meaning folk music.\n\nTheir albums UT, RE and MI have attracted widespread interest among international music critics across genres, and have frequently been featured among the best albums in yearly listings of classical, early as well as progressive music. Ensemble Gamut!'s imaginative style has been described as \"refreshing, soothing, intriguing and enlightening\". Their acclaimed performances have enchanted audiences from club gigs to museums, medieval churches and concert halls.\n\nIn 2026 Ensemble Gamut! will perform at a showcase at Tallinn Music Week and give concerts in Finland and Europe.\n\nAino Peltomaa I voice, harp, percussion\nIlkka Heinonen I jouhikkos, electronics, voice\nJuho Myllylä I blockflutes, voice\n\n“Album of the Year” recognition from Rondo magazine’s readers in Finland 2025: MI\nClassical:NEXT showcase artist 2024\nEmma Gaala (\"Ethno of the Year\") nomination 2024\nYLE (Finnish Broadcasting Company) record of the year nomination 2021\nEarly Music Achievement of the Year 2020 (Finnish Early Music Association)",

      "bio": "Dänkki Briha is an ethno-futuristic music collective inspired by Ingrian, Karelian, and Finnish folk traditions, myths, and urban aesthetics.

The songs feature southeastern Finnish dialects as well as smaller languages and dialects of closely related peoples, including Livvi Karelian and Veps.\n\nThe debut album Viipurin Kingpin (2024, Sick Boogie Recordings) has been widely played and well received. The second album is set for release in summer 2026.\n\nWith the song Marjut, Dänkki Briha placed third in the Etno-Espa Folk Song 2050 songwriting competition in 2024 and performed at the Kaustinen Showcase in 2025.",

      "bio": "Aizhan Sultan is a singer, songwriter and doctoral researcher based in Finland originally from Kazakhstan. Her compositions derive inspiration from Kazakh traditional and contemporary music. Her art reflects on her journey around the world and her inner political and social experiences.\n\nAizhan's work focuses on the topic of decolonisation of Central Asia and radical inclusion. As a woman living with achondroplasia, she has an intimate relationship with power as a source of oppression, but also solidarity and art as a power of emancipation. The traditional kazakh singing improvisation, throat singing and the sound of shanqobyz (jaw harp) is implemented with live electronics. The live electronics will bring a modern sound of Finnish music to the nomadic culture of Kazakhs.\n\nHer main goal is to represent and make accessible Central Asian, in particular Kazakh, music and art to the international audience. The author is giving the audience the opportunity to discover more the art and history of the Kazakhs. Aizhan Sultan gets inspiration for her music from the history and tradition of Nomadic culture combining them in the modern form.",

      "bio": "FLOS is an interdisciplinary concert concept, brought to life by Aino Peltomaa’s Ensemble Gamut! in collaboration with visual artist Vappu Rossi and sound artist Tuomas Norvio.\n\nThe theme of the performance centers on endangered flower species from the Arctic. Vappu Rossi creates large-scale, live-drawn artworks inspired by the flowers and Ensemble Gamut!’s music. Sound artist Tuomas Norvio produces real-time sound from Rossi’s drawing tools, giving the emerging forms of the flowers an audible presence for the audience.\n\nThus, endangered or already extinct arctic flowers appear to come to life in real time, surrounding the audience, intertwining with the musical soundscape of voice, harp, bells, Karelian bowed lyres, medieval blockflutes and electronic soundscapes.\n\nAino Peltomaa I voice, harp, percussion, artistic direction, production\nIlkka Heinonen I jouhikkos, electronics, voice\nJuho Myllylä I blockflutes, electronics, voice\nTuomas Norvio I live electronics\nVappu Rossi I live drawing on acoustic wall",
